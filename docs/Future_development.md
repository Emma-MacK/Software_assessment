## Future Development ##

This document dictates the changes and improvements we would aim to implement in the future

- Add testing that is not dependent on variant validator
- Update frontend to use tool_v2.py
- Update docker to save outputs directly to the local directory using environmental variables
- For database interaction, let the user pick where files going to the database are being pulled from
