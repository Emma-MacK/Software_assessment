# Coding Guidelines

Welcome to the coding guidelines for this project These guidelines follow the conventions outlined in [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/), the official style guide for Python code, with the adjustment that lines of code are allowed up to 99 characters.

We recommend using a linter extension such as pylint while coding.

Please note the ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` will forbid commits being made that don't adhere to these PEP 8 guidelines.
