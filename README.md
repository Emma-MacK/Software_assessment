Overview of the files structure 

Files:
modules.py – all the functions we create are held here to be called into the final script
tests.py, contains tests for each of the created functions, ensuring they work + also environment tests

For each added functionality, create and test function individually, add to modules.py, create a test in tests.py, add to main script.
